# Advent of Code 2019

This is a collection of solutions to the
[Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) programming problems
implemented in the C programming language. I have done my best to minimize time
complexity and running time.

Some of the more complex problems were implemented in a
[higher-level programming language](ref/) before being converted to C. The
equivalent code is included here as a reference.

## Usage

These programs are cross-platform, having been tested on Windows and Linux
operating systems.

**Important:** Do not use Windows-style line endings (`CR LF`, i.e. `\r\n`).
Only use Unix-style line endings (`LF`, i.e. `\n`).

**Important:** I have tested each program on the example test cases and two
puzzle input files - not a large sample size! I have avoided assumptions about
the input, sometimes even at the cost of performance. However, to avoid memory
allocation, all buffers have fixed sizes. Ensure that all buffers (see `#define`
statements) have sufficient capacity before running. Not doing so could result
in a stack smashing, segmentation fault, or worse.

## Summary

**Note:** The times below are expressed as orders of magnitude, not precise
figures. For example, a time of 0.00010 seconds indicates an average running
time between 0.00005 seconds and 0.00050 seconds.

## Constraints

I am working within the following constraints to ensure high code quality.

- Adhere to the [project style guide](cstyle.md).
- Final solutions must be implemented in the C programming language following
  the C99 standard.
  - Assume signed integer overflow is defined based on two\'s complement.
- All solutions must be standalone files with no user-defined headers and no
  external dependencies beyond the C standard library (`libc`) and the C
  mathematics library (`libm`). The first and second problems for a given day
  must be implemented separately.
- Bounds checking is not required for data structures whose capacity is defined
  by a macro.
- The return values of all C standard library functions must be checked, except
  for those returned from the following:
  - `fprintf`
  - `memcpy`
  - `printf`

## Omissions

- The solution must produce the correct result for the [examples](data/), not
  just the personalized puzzle input. This means that the efficient solutions to
  Day 10(b) and Day 21(b) are unfeasible. I have omitted both.
- By design, there is no efficient solution to Day 23(a) and (b). I have
  omitted both.
